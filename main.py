Hangman Game

Author: Moa Burke
Date: 26 Sept 2024
Description: This program implements a classic Hangman game where the player guesses letters to reveal a randomly selected word.
The player has limited number of incorrect guesses (lives) before losing the game. The game provides visual feedback through stages of the hangman,
displays the correctly guessed letters, tracks incorrect guesses and keeps track of the player's total wind and losses.
Additionally, it validated user input for both letter guesses and continuation of the game after each round.

Version: 1.1

Changelog:
- v1.1.1: Refined docstring format for the `prompt_exit_game` and `end_of_round` function.
- v1.1.0: Added tracking for total wins/losses, visual display of game outcome, and input validation for letter guesses and game continuation.
- v1.0.0: Initial release with basic gameplay functionality.
